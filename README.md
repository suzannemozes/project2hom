* In the interest of saving TKgallons of water every year, the fashion industry has begun sourcing remnant fabrics instead of simply putting them into landfills when the season is over. This shop obtains high fashion fabrics and sells them at discounted prices.

### Brief Example  
* This could be a code snippet showing how your project shoudl be used (if it is menat to be integrated into another app)  
* This could be a screenshot of your project running in the browser (if it is a stand-alone application)

### List of Features / User Stories 
* Typically a short list of the features / user stories that you planned during the development phase of the project
* To provide more detail, you can show how you categorized these features into Bronze, Silver and gold Levels and indicate which features you complete / have yet to complete


### List of Technologies
