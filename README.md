## Description
In the interest of saving millions of gallons of water and literal tons of wasted fabric every year, the fashion industry has begun sourcing remnant fabrics instead of simply putting them into landfills when a season is over. This shop obtains high fashion fabrics and sells them at discounted prices.


## User Stories

    When a user goes to the "/fabrics" route they will see an index of textile products, the names of each fabric or product rendered to the page.

    When a user clicks on the name or image of the fabric, the user will be taken to that fabric's Show page, and will see the fabric's name, description, price and image.

    When a user goes to "/fabrics/new" a user sees a form that allows them to create a new product, and then redirects the user back to the Index.

    When a user goes to the Show page there will be two buttons one that allows them to delete the fabric and get taken back to the Index page and one that takes them to "/fabric/:id/edit" that shows them a form which allows them to edit the data and save to the database.
